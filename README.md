## Description

This is a weather dashboard application that allows users to search for the current weather and 5-day forecast of multiple cities. The app uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data and dynamically updates the HTML and CSS to display the information. The application also stores the search history using localStorage so users can easily access previous searches.
